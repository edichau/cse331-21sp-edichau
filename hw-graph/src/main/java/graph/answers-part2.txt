A few examples of possible Graph representations:

    A: A collection of edges.
    B: An adjacency list, in which each node is associated with a list of its outgoing edges.
    C: An adjacency matrix, which explicitly represents, for every pair ⟨A,B⟩ of edges, whether there is a link from A to B, and how many.

1. In two or three sentences, explain an advantage and a disadvantage of each of the
representations listed above (for example, in terms of runtime complexity, space
complexity, or ease of implementation).

    A: A collection of edges would be the simplest, as it would be just that. A disadvantage would be that it would be difficult
        to run operations on a collection of edges, it would be less coherent as a graph.
    B: An adjacency list is what i went with, the advantage would be that that it is more coherent as a graph than just a collection of
        edges, and it is still relatively simple. A downside would be that it is difficult to iterate through the edges associated
        with each node, and is a little more complicated.
    C: An adjacency matrix would be the most complex, as it would be a whole matrix. Being complex would make it harder to get an idea
        of the whole graph but it would be the easiest to get specific data from.


2. In two to three sentences, describe the representation you chose and explain why you
chose it. If you chose to use a different representation than one of the three we described
above, be sure to list its advantages and disadvantages, too.

    I chose to do the adjacency list, it was the first one I thought of, and i thought
    it would be easiest to implement. I also liked the way it visualized, with each
    node being the center of the edges.

    (Please keep your answers brief and to-the-point.)

1. Describe any new tests you added and why you added them, or why you feel that your original
tests alone are sufficient.

    I did not add any more tests, because i thought i covered most cases with the 0,1,2 method.
    This also covered edge cases


2. Did you make any changes to your specifications as you were implementing your Graph? (yes/no)
If yes, describe your changes and why you made them.

    I changed the way listChildren worked. Instead of having it return a list of children, it would
    return a mini graph, of the children. I thought it make more sense this way.
